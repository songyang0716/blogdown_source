### About me
My name is Yang Song, I am a Data Scientist at [The Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/) - mainly focus on the [Home Services Program](http://www.homedepot.com/services/) and [Pro Referral Platform](https://www.proreferral.com/). In June 2015 I received my Master's Degree in Statistics from [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/). My interests include statistics, data analysis, data visulization, machine learning and programming in R and Python.

I enjoy teaching to others for things that I understand, and also looking forward to learning from others. When I write code I usually do it in Python and R, but historically I spent some time in Java and C++. I also have fair amount of experiences using Tableau for visualization purpose.

I am now living in the San Francisco Bay Area, I am a big sports fan, especially into Soccer and Basketball, [Guoan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Sinobo_Guoan_F.C.) is my most favorite team and one of my childhood dreams is to become a part of it.

Other random facts:

- I was grew up in Beijing and attended a [boarding school](http://www.bjroyalschool.com/) since 6 years old
- I started playing [FIFA soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_(video_game_series)) since 1999 and that's my only favorite game
- I have more than 10 pairs of [Air Jordan Shoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Jordan), the first pair is the AJ XII

### About this blog
I have been inspired by the active community of data science and benefited significantly from reading and following others' blogs and tutorials. My favorite data science blogs include, but not limited to [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/about/), [David Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/), [Julia Silge](http://juliasilge.com/) and [Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/index.html). After learning from these selfless people & teams, I decided to create my own portfolio to keep track on my learning process as well as share my knowledge to others. This blog will focus on natural language processing, data analysis, machine learning and data visualization by using real-world dataset.
